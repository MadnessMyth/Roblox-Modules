# Plugins
You may install some of these plugins if you'd like.

## TextShare
A plugin that can let you send messages and images using EditableImages and a custom replication system through Team Create with no moderation and it is encrypted.

# TextShare Credits
- EncData: Solution with github update checker

## NOTES

TextShare is still unsafe encrpytion wise as the encrpytion keys are stored within the plugin file. I plan on adding a "Password" that all parties must match to be able to communicate with eachother.
For now, it is only a method to keep you safe from Roblox Moderation checking attribute data from Instance replication.
